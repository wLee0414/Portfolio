            <h2 class="center">About Me</h2>
            <p>As a child, I've really enjoyed puzzles and gaming, especially logic-based ones like sudoku. 
            <p>As I was learning how to code, I really came to enjoy the logical approach one has to have in order to code, as it felt like I was solving a puzzle.</p>
            <p>I also enjoy that there is more than one way to solve a problem, and I think it's interesting that I can understand how they approached it and their thinking process just through their coding.</p>
